# Pig game project

This is the project that I originaly encountered in Jonas Schmedtmann JavaScript course. However, even the design is very similar,
I did my best to do it all without 'sneak peek' to Jonas super clean and efficient code. I also added few extra details with 
sounds, time delay when dice is rolled to 'one' etc...Rules and game info when user hover over pig nose icon.
